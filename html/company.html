              <h3>SCL Group</h3>
              <p>
                The Seoul Clinical Laboratories (SCL) was launched in 1983 as a medical institution specializing in
                clinical trials. Since the foundation, SCL has consistently pursued the three core values of quality,
                service and R&D. In 1997, the reliability of our clinical trials was recognized by obtaining
                certification form an international control institution, CAP.
                Since then, we have established ourselves as one of the nation’s best reference laboratories concerning
                diagnostic examination, pathology examination, special analysis and genetic diagnosis with the
                globalization of sample testing through the business partnership with LSIM in Japan, Mayo Clinic and
                Quest Diagnostics in the U.S., and Dian Lab in China.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, a number of our research papers have been published every year in the prestigious
                scientific journals thanks to our continuous research activities.
                <br> <br>
                Based on these continuous R&D efforts, SCL will provide the highest level of research services for
                clients, and all our researchers, including SCL specialists, will provide accurate inspection services
                through international quality control systems for all processes from inspection requests to reporting
                results.
                <br> <br>
                As the most professional committed research institution in Korea, SCL will continuously do our best by
                putting our customers first and become a patient-oriented international clinical research institution by
                studying state-of-the-art medicine based on evidence.
