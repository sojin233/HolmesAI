              We started in the Digital Diagnosis R&D Center in SCL, a machine learning scientist conducting basic and
              translational research in the application of machine learning in cardiology. We worked together, night

              We saw a need for a different kind of technology, a platform that brings together clinical, engineering
              and data expertise to power new waves of innovation. That’s why we founded HolmesAI.
