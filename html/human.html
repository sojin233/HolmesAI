              Heart disease causes death and disabilities worldwide, with the number od deaths caused by disease
              expected to reach 22.2million by 2030.

            <p>
              CLholmes® enhances human security by improving healthcare access, especially in medically underserved
              regions. According to the World Health Organization(WHO), 75% of heart disease cases occur in low and
              middle-income countries.
              CLholmes® revolutionizes healthcare accessibility by providing precise cardiac arrhythmia analysis results
              from any Smartwatch and SmartPatch data.
            </p>
            <p>
              This empowers individuals in remote regions and underdeveloped nations to predict their heart health in
              their daily lives proactively.
            </p>
            <p>
              Given that heart disease is a leading cause of death, early detection with CLholmes®'s technology not only
              reduces healthcare costs but also lowers mortality rates, ultimately enhancing public health.

              By 2030, 1 in 6 people in the world will be aged 60 years or over. At this time the share of the
              population aged 60 years and over will increase from 1 billion in 2020 to 1.4 billion. By 2050, the
              world’s population of people aged 60 years and older will double (2.1 billion).
              In 2050, 80% of older people will be living in low- and middle-income countries.
              The pace of population ageing is much faster than in the past.
              Common conditions in older age include heart disease and hearing loss and chronic obstructive pulmonary
              disease, diabetes, depression and dementia. As people age, they are more likely to experience several
              conditions at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
              As heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, our technology's early detection capability is
              crucial for individual health protection and offers substantial economic benefits. By identifying heart
              issues early, HolmesAI helps avoid expensive treatments and reduces healthcare costs, significantly
              lowering national mortality rates and contributing to overall public health improvement.

              CLholmes® low hardware requirements enable accurate diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias even in developing
              regions where access to high-performance analysis equipment is limited.
            </p>
            <p>
              CLholmes® offers software-based interventions tailored to treat, manage, or prevent medical conditions,
              accessible via a range of devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables. It encompasses a mobile
              application designed for patients with cardiac arrhythmia disease and a web platform for medical staff,
              facilitating comprehensive care and management of heart disease.
            </p>
            <p>
              CLholmes® integrates a GPT-4-based human-computer interaction service (Chatbot) that provides
              easy-to-understand and reliable analysis results. The GPT model, further trained on international
              arrhythmia diagnostic guidelines, analyzes ECG features extracted through CLholmes® Algorithm to provide
              users with detailed information about their cardiac health.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Chatbot not only offers advice on lifestyles to improve heart health but also provides personalized
              answers to questions related to cardiac arrhythmias in daily life. These features are especially useful in
              regions with limited medical services, helping individuals manage their health more effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the potential to increase treatment success rates for early-detected arrhythmias, CLholmes®
              contributes to a virtuous cycle of healthcare, where early detection and prevention save treatment costs
              and resources, enabling more people to access medical care.
