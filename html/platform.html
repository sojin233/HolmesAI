              Being able to predict an episode of cardiac arrhythmias early enough would allow patients to take
              preventive measures to keep their cardiac rhythm stable. However, current methods based on the analysis of
              heart rate and electrocardiogram (ECG) data are only able to detect atrial fibrillation right before its
